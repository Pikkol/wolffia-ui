# Wolffia-UI

Wolffia-UI is an opinionated charting library, built with React, D3 and Tailwindcss. The aim is to make a lightweight library, which is

- Responsive
- consistent and easy to style
- Support theming (Dark theme)
- Support interactivity

## To initiate Wolffia-ui in a react app:

1. Start a create-react-app with <br/>
   <code>npx create-react-app your_app_name</code>
2. Initiate tailwindcss <br/> https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
3. Install d3 & luxon (Luxon will be removed at a later release) <br/>
   <code>npm install --save d3 luxon </code>{" "}
4. Install wolffia-ui <br/>
   <code>npm install --save wolffia-ui </code>

## How to use

1. Import the chart that you want.

For example:

`import { LineChart } from "wolffia-ui";`

2. Use the chart inside the component.

`<LineChart id="line-chart" data={data} />`

### Things to remember

1. Every chart needs a unique **id**.

Why?
This is done so, so that D3 can target the correct chart in case multiple charts are there on the page.

### Storybook notes:

If you are new to storybook, please go through the below notes.

1. There are two crescent moon icons at the top, which toggles two dark modes.
   a. Toggle the left one to toggle dark mode on the rendered canvas (applies tailwind)
   b. Toggle the right one to toggle dark mode on storybook (does NOT work on the rendered canvas, or the charts)

The purposes of both are different. The first one is for UI development, the second is for viewers to choose how they want to read the docs.
Please click both on "Canvas" mode to see actual dark mode.

2. To view multiple screen-sizes, Click the multi-screen icon at the top. Once you change orientation, refresh the chart for the new layout to take effect.
