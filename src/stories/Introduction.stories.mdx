# Wolffia-UI

Wolffia-UI is a charting library, built with React, D3 and Tailwindcss. The aim is to make a lightweight library, which is

- Responsive
- consistent and easy to style
- Support theming (Dark theme)
- Support interactivity

To initiate Wolffia-ui in a react app:

1. Start a create-react-app with <br/>
   <code>npx create-react-app your_app_name</code>
2. Initiate tailwindcss <br/> https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
3. Install d3 & luxon (Luxon will be removed at a later release) <br/>
   <code>npm install --save d3 luxon </code>{" "}
4. Install wolffia-ui <br/>
   <code>npm install --save wolffia-ui </code>

### FAQ

#### 1. Why D3?

We love D3js. It's the best thing since sliced bread.

#### 2. Why tailwind?

Simply put. The flexibility tailwind gives to style DOM elements is something we love. This helps us keep the library light, and styling completely flexible.

#### 3. Do I have to learn D3 to use wolffia-ui?

Unless you want to write your own charts, No.

#### 4. Do I have to learn how to use Tailwind to use Wolffia-ui?

Well, yes. However, once you understand the working of tailwind, you'll realize that it is just a bunch of classNames. You will just need to keep referring to this page - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first

#### 5. Instead of learning tailwind, can I give my own classNames and write my CSS?

Why, of course. In fact, if you want to write your own animations which are not there in Tailwind, you may need to write your own CSS. That may take your charts to the next level.
