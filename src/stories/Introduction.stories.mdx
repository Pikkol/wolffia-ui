# Wolffia-UI

Wolffia-UI is an opinionated charting library, built with React, D3 and Tailwindcss. The aim is to make a lightweight library, which is

- Responsive
- consistent and easy to style
- Support theming (Dark theme)
- Support interactivity, animations

## Developer Notes

## To initiate Wolffia-ui in a react app:

1. Start a create-react-app with <br/>
   <code>npx create-react-app your_app_name</code> <br />
   Or any other bundler.
2. Initiate tailwindcss <br/> https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
3. Install d3 & luxon (Luxon will be removed at a later release) <br/>
   <code>npm install --save d3 luxon </code>{" "}
4. Install wolffia-ui <br/>
   <code>npm install --save wolffia-ui </code>

## How to use

1. Import the chart that you want.

For example:

`import { LineChart } from "wolffia-ui";`

2. Use the chart inside the component.

`<LineChart id="line-chart" data={data} />`

### Things to remember

#### 1. Every chart needs a unique **id**.

Why?
This is done so, so that D3 can target the correct chart in case multiple charts are there on the page.

#### 2. margin{Left/Right/Bottom/Top} and padding{Left/Right/Bottom/Top} props of charts refer to the chart area (not the entire svg).

The svg can be styled using the className prop of the chart.

#### 3. Toggle dark mode in your App using Tailwind.

Normal text color is black and dark mode text is white. Normal background is white, while dark mode background color is bg-gray-900.
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors. Override this by text-{color}, dark:text-{color}, bg-{color} and dark:bg-{color}.

#### 4. Target all charts using the `.chart` selector and `@apply` styles as per tailwind.

#### 5. Individual items of a chart can be given classes by className{componentName} prop.

Refer to that chart's documentation of how to target that sub-component. Rectangles & lines have a default fill-current and/or stroke-current className (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/fill), so you will just need to set text-{color}.

#### 6. Code for conditional styling lies outside the library, and needs to be in the component which calls it.

Why?
We couldn't use a few libraries since we did not have control over finer styling. This gives the flexibility to the developer to attach a styling classNames to a chart component.

### Storybook notes:

If you are new to storybook, please go through the below notes.

1. There are two crescent moon icons at the top, which toggles two dark modes.
   a. Toggle the left one to toggle dark mode on the rendered canvas (applies tailwind)
   b. Toggle the right one to toggle dark mode on storybook (does NOT work on the rendered canvas, or the charts)

The purposes of both are different. The first one is for UI development, the second is for viewers to choose how they want to read the docs.
Please click both on "Canvas" mode to see actual dark mode.

2. To view multiple screen-sizes, Click the multi-screen icon at the top. Once you change orientation, refresh the chart for the new layout to take effect.
